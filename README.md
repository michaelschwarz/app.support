# Michael Schwarz - iOS and macOS App Support

## Support & Privacy

Thank you for using one of my iOS or macOS apps!
If you’re here for help, feedback, or just want to learn more about how your data is handled — you’re in the right place.

### Support & Feedback
If you have a question, found a bug, or want to suggest a new feature, please create an issue on GitHub. You’re also welcome to leave general feedback or just say hello — I’d love to hear from you!

### Privacy
Your privacy matters. My apps do not collect or track any personal data — no analytics, no ads, no background data collection.
Some apps may ask for access to your photos, but only when necessary for their core functionality. This access stays strictly on your device and is never uploaded or shared.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out via GitHub.
